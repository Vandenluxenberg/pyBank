# Python Bank Account Manager

Create bank accounts for multiple users (database stored in a dictionary) then deposit and withdraw money from them.

TO DO LIST :
- Save/load accounts database to/from a JSON file. Or maybe an SQLite db.
- Clear screen between each menu occurence (+ eventually remove sleep() calls)
- Add error handling for non numeric inputs during deposit/withdraw
